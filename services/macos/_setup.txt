/*
 * Elastic Stack Setup on Mac OS for Elastic Search, Kibana and Filebeat
 * For simplicity we'll run the service under our own user account
 */

Download and unzip under a root folder:
* /Users/gary/logaggregation/elasticsearch-7.2.0/
* /Users/gary/logaggregation/filebeat-7.2.0-darwin-x86_64/
* /Users/gary/logaggregation/kibana-7.2.0-darwin-x86_64/

Set paths in plist files and copy them to this folder:
* ~/Library/LaunchAgents

Install agents, which will then run on every reboot:
* launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/elasticsearch.plist
* launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/kibana.plist
* launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/filebeat.plist

Unload if required:
* launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/elasticsearch.plist
* launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/kibana.plist
* launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/filebeat.plist

Check if running:
* launchctl list | grep elasticsearch
* launchctl list | grep kibana
* launchctl list | grep filebeat
